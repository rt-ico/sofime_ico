                    <p>OpenAGE enables an agile approach for building business applications. This
                        approach implies a "back-office" approach with standardized navigation and a
                        standardized look-and-feel built using a standard set of user interface
                        widgets arranged around a master-detail style user interface.</p>
                    <p>Despite being standardized, forms and lists in the OpenAGE back-office are
                        often flexible enough for many applications, and are augmented by extension
                        points for implementing business rules and workflow, as well as using
                        built-in security profiles for controlling access and visibility of
                        information, and flexible searching tools (free-text search and structured
                        advanced search).</p>
                    <p>OpenAGE Viewer is primarily designed to add flexibility to the way in
                        which information is made available, modified, and to the way in which users
                        can navigate, search, and display information. Whereas the back-office is
                        designed for productivity in terms of structuring data, the front-office is
                        designed for productivity in customizing presentation and navigation (whilst
                        leveraging all the advantages of security profiles and business rules
                        handled by the back-office).</p>
                    <p>The front-office delegates data access, security profiles, and business
                        rules to the back-office. It provides several levels of customization:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

                    <p>OpenAGE Viewer is aimed at front-end developers and graphic designers. As
                        such, it is designed to make it easy to get instant feedback on design
                        changes, as well as to deploy them.</p>
                    <p>Shared media files (such as pictures, video, and audio) can be dropped in
                        and made instantly available. Visual themes can be easily organized into
                        packages of templates, each with their own collection of packages of
                        stylesheets. These templates and stylesheets are easy to edit directly with
                        existing visual design tools and text editors, whatever you prefer. When you
                        are satisfied with the result, it is easy to package up and deploy these
                        design assets on a production server.</p>
                    <p>When you need to go even further and add customized behavior (security
                        profiles, business logic, or navigation), this can be done using robust
                        industry-standard OSGi Java-based plug-in technology. Java code using our
                        documented API can be compiled and deployed without having to restart the
                        OpenAGE Viewer server, and can even be modified and replaced as many times
                        as you need, without needing to restart the server.</p>
